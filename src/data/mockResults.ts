  fullAnalysis: 'The claim that vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly investigated and debunked by the scientific community. The original 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, which suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, was found to be fraudulent and was retracted. Since then, numerous large-scale studies involving hundreds of thousands of children across multiple countries have found no evidence of a causal relationship between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders.\n\nKey studies include a 2019 Danish study of 657,000 children, a 2014 meta-analysis covering 1.2 million children, and a 2002 population study in Denmark of 537,000 children. All of these studies consistently found no increased risk of autism in vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children.\n\nMajor health organizations worldwide, including the CDC, WHO, and leading pediatric associations, maintain that vaccines are safe and do not cause autism. The scientific consensus is clear and overwhelming.',

Despite clear evidence to the contrary from astronauts who have actually been to space, the myth has persisted in popular culture, textbooks, and tourist materials.\n\nScientific analysis shows that the angular resolution of the human eye (approximately 1 arcminute) combined with atmospheric interference makes it impossible to resolve structures as narrow as the Great Wall from orbital altitudes. While the wall is an impressive engineering feat spanning over 21,000 kilometers, its visibility from space is a myth that has been definitively debunked by those who have actually observed Earth from orbit.',
